      "Q: Why do the tea leaves gather in the middle of the cup when stirred?\n",
      "A: This is because the water near the edges of the cup moves faster than the water in the center, creating a mini whirlpool in the middle. This whirlpool pushes the tea leaves towards the center of the cup.\n",

      " - Type: <class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>, Content: The tea leaf paradox is a phenomenon that occurs when you stir a cup of tea with tea leaves at the bottom. You might think that the leaves would be pushed to the outside of the cup because of the force of the water, but in reality, the leaves gather in the middle of the cup. This is because stirring creates a small whirlpool in the cup, causing the water at the surface to move faster than the water at the bottom. This difference in speed creates a pressure difference, which pulls the leaves into the center of the cup.\n",

      " - Type: <class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>, Content: The tea leaf paradox is a phenomenon often seen when you stir a cup of tea and the tea leaves collect in the center, rather than being thrown to the edges. This seems strange because we'd expect the rotation of the liquid to push the leaves to the side of the cup. This happens due to a difference in the speed of rotation between the top and bottom of the liquid. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you stir your tea, the top layer of liquid moves faster than the bottom layer, because of friction between the liquid and the cup. This causes a small whirlpool or vortex to form, where the liquid is moving downwards in the center and upwards at the edges. The tea leaves are then carried downwards and then pushed towards the center by the upward-moving liquid at the edges. This is why the leaves gather in the middle of the cup, a process known as 'centripetal force'. \n",
