      " - Type: <class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>, Content: Madhubani painting is a cool art form from India. It is a way of drawing and coloring that starts with making a rough sketch using a pencil. Then, the artist goes over that with a pen, using special black ink. The picture is then filled in with bright colors like red, blue, green, and yellow. The pictures often show things like sun, moon, trees, animals, and people. This kind of art is really special because it tells stories and traditions from the artist's culture.\n",
